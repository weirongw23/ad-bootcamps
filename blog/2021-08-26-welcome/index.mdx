**Help make Atlas Digital Bootcamps better**

-   Add yourself to the author's list in `authors.yaml`
-   Check out the documentation by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs)

** Adding tutorials/blogs **

-   For tutorials, simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `docs` directory.
-   For blog posts, add Markdown or MDX files to the `blog` directory. The blog post date (along with other metadata) can be extracted from filenames, such as:
    -   `2023-01-02-welcome.md`
    -   `2023-01-03-welcome/index.md`
-   If you're looking to add images, make the blog post name into a folder titled `<date>-<blog_name>`, and then add `index.md` or `index.mdx`. This folder will host the blog itself along with other images, videos, and more. Here is an example:
    ![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)

-   The blog supports tags as well! Check out the tags at the top of each `*.md` or `*.mdx` file for the `tags` section.

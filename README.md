# Atlas Digital Bootcamps

[Atlas Digital](https://atlasdigital.org/) is a student-led consulting group dedicated to making a positive impact by providing software to nonprofits, high-growth startups, and F500 companies.

## Introduction

Welcome everyone! This is the first edition of tutorials to help you get contributing on your project as soon as possible.

These tutorials are made for analysts of all backgrounds. It covers basic scripting, the internals of Git, and full-stack development.

The goal of these bootcamps is to create a box of tutorials and walkthroughs that help you _understand_ the basic concepts behind the tech stack we're using and what the project workflow looks like.

Since these bootcamps are relatively new, please send us feedbacks so we can make it better for everyone.

## Local Development

First, clone the repository from Github. Then, run `npm run start` to start the development server. As you modify the JavaScript and Markdown pages, the changes will be automatically reflected on the browser (as long as you don't close the terminal session).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:weirongw23/ad-bootcamps.git
$ npm run start
```

### Getting Started

If the above command does not work, this command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

## Alternative Methods

Interested in contributing to Atlas Digital bootcamps? We'd love to see your work. Here are the ways to contribute:

2. Clone the repository, add some features, and create a pull request.
